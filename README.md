# Security and Authentication using Google

## Project Description

- Welcome to our Authentication Project, This project is a simple project where a user can login or register to the website and he/she can share his secrets to others and a user can see the other users secrets(not like passwords ...just funny sercrets) and users will not get to know about who's secret it is  
- But the major part of this project is a makeing a secure user authentication powered by Express.js, Passport.js, and MongoDB. Fortified with hashing and salting techniques, this Node.js masterpiece ensures your online safety. Whether you prefer traditional local authentication (username/password) or the effortless charm of Google OAuth2.0, this project is your gateway to a secure, hassle-free, and unbreakable login experience.

### Features at a Glance
